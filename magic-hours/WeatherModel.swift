If defined, this property will have one of the following values: clear-day, clear-night, rain, snow, sleet, wind, fog, cloudy, partly-cloudy-day, or partly-cloudy-night. (Developers should ensure that a sensible default is defined, as additional values, such as hail, thunderstorm, or tornado, may be defined in the future.)
